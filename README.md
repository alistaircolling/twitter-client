# Twitter Checker

This application allows you to search for the tweets from a number of users. It can be operated without a mouse.

You can view a live version of the app [here](https://main.d3ff8px0vun6my.amplifyapp.com/)

## Still to do

- Improve src folder structure
- Add tests
- Better error handling
- Improve styling

## Dependency choices made

As time is limited I have used React Bootstrap for rapid UI development. The application was deployed using AWS Amplify.

## Running the Application Locally

`npm i`
`npm start`

## Building for production

`npm run build`
